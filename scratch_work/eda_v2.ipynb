Sean marks, a 6”11 center, was the 44th draft pick in the 1998 NBA draft, and went on to play for six different teams over his 11 season career. Kirk Penny, the former New Zealand Breakers star, went un-drafted in 2003, but had a taste of the NBA game in small stints with the Miami Heat and Los Angeles Clippers. \\n Basketball fans in New Zealand look once again to have a kiwi to cheer for on the American hardwood. Rotorua native, Steven Adams, has chosen to forgo his remaining three seasons of eligibility in the NCAA as a 7ft center for Pittsburgh, and declare for this years NBA draft. Pittsburgh fans were hearing whispers of the possibility of Adams being a “one and done” prospect when he first arrived on campus, but as his first season progressed, there was a sense around the program that he may choose to hone his skills under the tutelage of coach Jamie Dixon for another year or two, before he took the gamble of the NBA draft. \\n Once a player signs an agent, and declares for the draft, he no longer is eligible to play college basketball again, and loses all of the perks that come with the college scholarship – tuition, room &board, travel, medical support, gear etc. Totaled up, this can be worth as much as US$75,000-US$100,000 per year. This obviously pales in comparison to NBA guaranteed contracts, but unless you get drafted in the first round (top 30), nothing is guaranteed! Players taken in the second round are often shipped to European leagues for development, or given one to two year minimal deals. Very few second-round players stay in the league more than a couple of years (unless they are seven foot tall). \\n DraftExpress.com has Adams projected to be selected at 19, and NBAdraft.net has him going at 24. This would have him receiving US$1,223,200 or US$997,000 respectively for the first year of his three-year guaranteed rookie contract (for the full rookie salary scale see s \\n Sean Marks has shown that big guys who stay healthy and do the basics right can keep a job in the NBA for a long time¬–as the saying goes “you can’t teach height”.\\nThis puts young Adams in a great position to have a long and prosperous career. Even is he sees little to no playing time in during his initial rookie contract, by his entering the league at a very young age, teams are likely to want to invest in him for a second contract, as age and time to develop will be well on his side. \\n I for one will be rooting for Steven Adams to go far, so much so that I will be willing to lay down my long-time loyalty to my beloved Detroit Pistons, should his team ever play against them. The NBA has the world’s greatest athletes make up its rosters, and now we can once again have Kiwi pride that one of our own will be amongst the biggest and best the world can offer.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"jQQkOclWyt0l"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
