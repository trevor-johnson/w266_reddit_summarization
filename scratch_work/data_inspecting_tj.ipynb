She kinda took me for granted and hit me when we were in arguments. She\\'s also really clingy and we used to get in arguments because I wanted to Bro out with my buddies. We were together since high school and did the whole long distance relationship (stupid, but I tried) for about a year while I went to college. I broke up with her when I was back home but things didn\\'t really go well.

The bad group projects always revolved around doing a paper together--something that just doesn't need to be a team project.\">, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'the charts are correct.'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'funny'>)\n","(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'StewPidaz'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b\"Carl is the worst.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not about what you specifically choose to do, but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to a movie since you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about the mentality you take walking in. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go in thinking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to sleep with you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder what you look like naked.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Very shallow approach. Most commonly, people think of first dates like interviews where you try and sell your best qualities in order to attract a potential mate. Fuck that. You aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a product up for auction with an ebay description. If you want to get into a relationship, learn to love yourself before you can love another. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the mentality to take. Your date is fascinating, or else you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be on the date in the first place. If you are on the date only because of her beauty, fix your priorities. Because your date is fascinating, learn as much as you can about her. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it 20 questions though. Start small, swap stories. Then ask for details, referencing back to important parts of the stories she told you. Prove that you are listening. Transition into asking about the people she cares about, like her family and her best friends. Remember their names. Finally, talk about the big ideas, like things you are passionate about and can rant about, about big dreams and aspirations. Make sure you have a unique perspective about a topic. Be really knowledgeable about things you care about. If she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s non-judgmental, you can talk about the geekiest things if you frame it in the right way. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of dating like a chase, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a mutual agreement of attraction. \\n\\nIf all goes well and you walk her back home, you have the chance for the first kiss. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty easy to read if she wants to kiss. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll delay going inside, rustle her keys, stumble on words, or shuffle her feet. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be nervous, you got this. Tell yourself \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is simple, and I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t screw up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Be patient with everything. Even if the date went amazing, make the kiss gentle, short, and sweet. Wet your lips slightly. A lip bite can be very attractive. I like to grab her chin and pull her up. Lean in, and press your lips together about as hard as if you were puckering up to apply invisible lipstick. Be relaxed, take steady breaths, and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use tongue, even if she goes for it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about her wanting more. Pull back and look her square in eye. Say quietly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen are you free next? I want to see you again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When she replies positively, say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome over, I am going to cook for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it a question, state it as a fact. Be assertive. On your walk home, quiz yourself on the things she said. Really genuinely try to remember the night in full detail, so she never has to repeat the things she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already told you. \\n\\n\\nSecond date is where you can really show that you are worth dating. Learn to cook. As a man, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a basic life skill. Have a signature gourmet recipe that requires prep, a wonderful way to bond in the kitchen. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cheap out on the ingredients. I can tell the difference between dollar cheese slices and a freshly cut, four year aged cheddar wedge from a mile away. Take your time eating, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to talk nearly as much. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where you can show that you can be fun to be around even in occasional silence. Bring into your clean, nice smelling room for the next part. Propose to watch some short comedy clips, or play a card or board game. This is how you transition onto the bed. I prefer to give massages. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s winter, turn off the heat in the room so you have an excuse to snuggle under the blankets. Same deal with the first kiss. There will be a natural break in conversation. \\n\\n\\nAt this point, this is the best chance for the first serious kissing session. Tell this to yourself.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome get me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Remember, patience is key. The best kissing sessions are a mix between assertiveness and submissiveness. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be tempted to immediately go hot and heavy. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Take her bangs and tuck it behind her ear. Give the same gentle style kisses, and have a nice rhythm without being robotic. When she starts getting into it, pull back. Tell her you are going to turn off the lights. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll expect you to jump straight into sex or serious foreplay. Again, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Cuddle up next to her, face to face. Pull her chin toward you. I like to repeat the chin move since it sets up a clear association, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I touch your chin, it means I want to kiss you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be tempted to go in for a crazy make out session, resist the urge. Start off extraordinarily gentle, where you caress her lips with your upper lip. Close your mouth slightly to give a small peck. Stay on the gentle path, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see her tense up from frustration. At this point, slide your hand from her chin to the small of her back and pull her in hard. When you kiss her this time, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t face mash, but be strong. Take a super deep inhale when you go in. Most girls respond with an audible moan. Let her control the tongue usage. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to gross her out if she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like French kisses. At this point, you are both very into it. I like to whisper a few things in between breaths. If she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being too forceful, say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgentle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d if too weak, say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmore,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just right, say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chmm (Woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I have a very deep voice and I can speak Spanish. So I like to take her hand and place it on my throat so she can feel it vibrate when I roll my r\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Change up the rhythm from strong to slow so you can take slight breathers. When the kissing session is at its most intense, slow it down to a crawl until you can set up the exit kisses, which are pretty much the same as the first kisses. End it with a peck. Rest your head into the cradle of her neck. Start from the top and kiss your way down softly until you find the spot. Every girl has the spot on her neck that sets her off. Once you find it, trace your tongue in circles near the spot, but not right on it. This is usually when her nails go into my back. \\n\\n\\nSeparate and look at her without saying a word. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be out of breath at this point. Stay on your side, and tap her lip with your lip. Then stay very close without touching. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll move in, and pull back playfully. This is where you let her take full control. In my experience, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll grab the back of your head and force you to kiss her. Let her. Caress her butt. When the kissing session is at the height of its intensity, grab the back of her thigh and swing her leg over you so she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s straddling you. Lean back and whisper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Let her dictate how far she takes it. Never rush things beyond where she is comfortable. Rub her butt at the calm moments, squeeze it hard when she comes hard. At this point, you are pretty much set. Personally, I never let things go further than that point. The mystery is fun. Afterwards, cuddle up and enjoy the best thing in the world, pillow talk. \\n\\n\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on your own after this. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the old clich\\xc3\\xa9, be yourself. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, but be the best yourself you can be. Be someone you can be proud of. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true even if you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in a relationship. Also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a dick to her. Never treat her like a piece of meat, but also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put her on a pedestal and think of her like a princess. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your equal, your companion. Do the small things that show you care. I like to make breakfast in bed, (personal favorite: slow cooked eggs with cr\\xc3\\xa8me fraiche, ground pepper, sea salt, chopped parsley and topped with diced smoked salmon.) Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one cheeseball gesture. Fold an origami rose and slide it covertly behind her ear when you put her bangs back. Nice surprise when she looks in the mirror. \\n\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a complete nerd, and I used to have real confidence issues. But now I tell myself the same mantra you should tell yourself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome get me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nTL:DR Treat a woman in public like you would want your daughter to be treated.

If she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being too forceful, say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgentle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d if too weak, say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmore,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just right, say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chmm (Woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I have a very deep voice and I can speak Spanish. So I like to take her hand and place it on my throat so she can feel it vibrate when I roll my r\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Change up the rhythm from strong to slow so you can take slight breathers. When the kissing session is at its most intense, slow it down to a crawl until you can set up the exit kisses, which are pretty much the same as the first kisses. End it with a peck. Rest your head into the cradle of her neck. Start from the top and kiss your way down softly until you find the spot. Every girl has the spot on her neck that sets her off. Once you find it, trace your tongue in circles near the spot, but not right on it. This is usually when her nails go into my back. \\n Separate and look at her without saying a word. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be out of breath at this point. Stay on your side, and tap her lip with your lip. Then stay very close without touching. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll move in, and pull back playfully. This is where you let her take full control. In my experience, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll grab the back of your head and force you to kiss her. Let her. Caress her butt. When the kissing session is at the height of its intensity, grab the back of her thigh and swing her leg over you so she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s straddling you. Lean back and whisper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Let her dictate how far she takes it. Never rush things beyond where she is comfortable. Rub her butt at the calm moments, squeeze it hard when she comes hard. At this point, you are pretty much set. Personally, I never let things go further than that point. The mystery is fun. Afterwards, cuddle up and enjoy the best thing in the world, pillow talk. \\n You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on your own after this. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the old clich\\xc3\\xa9, be yourself. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, but be the best yourself you can be. Be someone you can be proud of. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true even if you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in a relationship. Also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a dick to her. Never treat her like a piece of meat, but also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put her on a pedestal and think of her like a princess. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your equal, your companion. Do the small things that show you care. I like to make breakfast in bed, (personal favorite: slow cooked eggs with cr\\xc3\\xa8me fraiche, ground pepper, sea salt, chopped parsley and topped with diced smoked salmon.) Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one cheeseball gesture. Fold an origami rose and slide it covertly behind her ear when you put her bangs back. Nice surprise when she looks in the mirror. \\n I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a complete nerd, and I used to have real confidence issues. But now I tell myself the same mantra you should tell yourself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI got this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome get me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'Treat a woman in public like you would want your daughter to be treated.
