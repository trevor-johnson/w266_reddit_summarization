I\\'m going to tell you about Raidkraft! Raidkraft is a Tekkit server that was fired up earlier this year by the folks who run the Raidkraft \"vanilla minecraft\" server. This 100-slot, UK-based server is run by a group of very serious and dedicated individuals who strive to make your tekkit experience an awesome one! Now then, let\\'s get down to the nitty-gritty! \\n The Awesome stuff \\n \\n Mutli-world Towny server. \\n Worlds are divided into a Mining, Nether, and Town world. \\n Mining/Nether world is completely FFA PvP/raiding/griefing(couple rules, but not many). \\n Town world is completely protected and designed to let players build in a plot-system. If you\\'ve played with Towny, you\\'ll get the idea. If not, swing by, and we\\'ll teach you! \\n Multiple towns support a growing player economy, and majorly expanded trade and admin shops have many things to offer growing players. \\n Economy runs on \"mana\" currency. This can be gained by players a couple different ways. Easiest is via voting for the tekkit server on the various server sites we post to. You can also trade with other players, kill monsters, and sell/buy resources at the multiple Server/Town shops. \\n Easy-to-access spawn and warp points: The server\\'s spawn and help areas are some of the best put-together areas I\\'ve ever seen. You will have no issues finding out what you want to know, provided you can spend some time reading. If you can read this entire post, you\\'ll be fine! \\n Monster Arena! Test your mettle against the nastiest nasties that Minecraft has to offer. Earn mana! Get the babes! Get cool items! \\n \\n The Awwwwww Man stuff \\n \\n EE is off. We don\\'t want to talk about it. There will be no debates about balance vs fun vs anything. Alchy bags/chests and the materials to craft those are allowed, but that\\'s it! The economy and player population is such that, with some work on your part, you\\'ll be able to gather what you need to make crazy tekkit contraptions. If you think you need EE2 to play Tekkit, you\\'re probably not someone who will enjoy Raidkraft. \\n Certain items/commands/etc are disabled to regular players. This info is available as part of the /warp help system. Donations to the server are not required, but a robust system is in place to detail what perks come with donations. One more time----donations are in no way mandatory, and are not a requirement to play on Raidkraft. \\n The Mining world is FFA PvP/raiding/griefing. Why is this in both sections, you ask? Because mod/admins are not going to help you if your stuff is stolen. Mods/admins are not going to help you if a nano-armored guy with a diamond sword swoops down with his jetpack and kills you while you\\'re farming piggies. Aside from a few minor rules (spawn-camping is FORBIDDEN), it\\'s anything goes! If you can\\'t handle that, you may want to go elsewhere. \\n The Mining world is periodically reset. What\\'s this mean? Nothing is sacred. Building in the mining world is hazardous, but also the only way to reliably gather materials you need to survive and build in the town world. The dates for the world reset are posted at the world spawn, so be mindful! (Nether resets VERY rarely. Maybe 3-4 times a year.) \\n \\n If the sound of this server excites you, then come by and hang out with us.

Unlike many European cities, with lots of historic buildings, these usually go right through downtown, or very close to it. As these roads began going up, the new middle class could start to move out and own their very own house, instead of staying in the city. This is the classic 'American Dream'. As all the middle class left, the urban center usually turned into a much more rundown part of town--business fled, and the process snowballed. Although this is now turning around, many American cities are basically deserted at night.\\n\\x1c\\n\\x06author\\x12\\x12\\n\\x10\\n\\x0eMagicWalrusO_o\\n\\x1a\\n\\tsubreddit\\x12\\r\\n\\x0b\\n\\tAskReddit\">\n","<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'\\n\\xd0\\x13\\n\\x1d\\n\\tsubreddit\\x12\\x10\\n\\x0e\\n\\x0cEntrepreneur\\n\\x9a\\x06\\n\\x04body\\x12\\x91\\x06\\n\\x8e\\x06\\n\\x8b\\x06\"how should I go about getting customers?\" - No one is responding to this portion of your post because this is of course easier said than done and you are better off searching Google.
