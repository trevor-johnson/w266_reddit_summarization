# Reddit TLDR Abstractive Summarization Model

We present a method to produce abstractive summaries of informal social media text via neural abstractive summarization. 
We test a model that has achieved state-of-the-art text summarization performance in the news domain and evaluate its performance in the social media domain.
In addition, we test models trained on smaller genre specific datasets against a model trained on a larger dataset that includes all genres 
to assess if training on a smaller specialized dataset can produce higher ROUGE scores. 
In almost all cases, we find a model trained on a larger generalized dataset produces higher ROUGE scores than comparable models 
trained on smaller specialized datasets.
